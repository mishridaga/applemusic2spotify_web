This repository contains the front-end code for my Spotify Web App which handles playlist conversion from Apple Music to Spotify.

To Do: 
  1. Convert to a react based web page instead of raw html, css, js 
  2. Figure out how to deal with resizing page
  3. Learn how to create a mobile version of page
